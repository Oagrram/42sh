# 42sh

This project consists of creating a complete shell from scratch, by repeating the work done on your 21sh. You are required to have a minimum set of features, from which you will build your own mature shell - potentially going all the way to job control and shell script. This project therefore allows you to see or review a very wide range of standard UNIX (and POSIX) features.
